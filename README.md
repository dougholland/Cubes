# visionOS Cubes Sample

Cubes provides a simple illustration of several features of visionOS apps written using SwiftUI and RealityKit. It was written using Xcode 15.4 and has been tested on visionOS 1.2, both within the simulator and deployed to a device.

The app displays three cubes that can be rotated when looking at them and using a drag gesture while pinching your thumb and finger together. Within the simulator, you simply use the mouse as a drag gesture. As the cubes are rotated observe the ground shadow on the plane below the cubes. There are two buttons on the toolbar, the first one allows you to reset the cubes to their original position and the second one enables gravity so you can observe the physics that result from collisions. You'll also hear the collisions with sounds originating from the position of the cubes.
